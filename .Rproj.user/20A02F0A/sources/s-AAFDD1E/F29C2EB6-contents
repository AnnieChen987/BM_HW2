# Question 1
## a)
```{r}
 # x : the number of cases of uveal melanoma
 # n = 8500000 people, p = 5/1000000 prob
n = 8500000
p = 5/1000000
dbinom(30,n,p)
```
the probability that there are exactly 30
cases occur in NYC in 2018 is `0.00934306`

## b)
```{r}
pn = 6.02/1000000
pb = 0.31/1000000
pa = 0.39/1000000

nn = 8500000 * 0.428
nb = 8500000 * 0.243
na = 8500000 * 0.14

#pn30 = dbinom(30,nn,pn)
#pb30 = dbinom(30,nb,pb)
#pa30 = dbinom(30,na,pa)
```
The probability of having exactly 30 cases occur is `r dbinom(30,nn,pn)` in non-Hispanic Whites,`r dbinom(30,nb,pb)` in black, `r dbinom(30,na,pa)` in Asians.
